## Git Champs
## Practice git commands
## Instructions
Add your first name to this list in the class.md file by making a pull request to my repo. It helped me a ton a while ago! The more I practice, the more I feel I can use git in my job / projects. I hope you all have fun! 

### Step 1
- Fork my repo
- Clone it to your computer as you practice on class.
- In the command line, cd into that folder and open the class.md file
- Add your name with an asterisk (*) like the one that's already in the list.
- Now, do the following:
```
git status
git commit -m "Jenn is going to UCB bootcamp"
git push
```

*Note:* Make sure to replace 'Jenn' with your own name.
